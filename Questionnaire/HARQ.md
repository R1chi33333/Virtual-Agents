## Reasons for Removing These Items

1. **“The character often said things completely out of place.”**  
   - **Reason**: In some of our VR scenes, the agent does not speak aloud and interacts only through presence, gestures, or simple cues. This item focuses on the appropriateness of spoken content, which is not applicable to agents who do not or cannot talk. Therefore, it must be removed.

2. **“I think that the character finds me likeable.”**  
   - **Reason**: This item asks users to infer the agent’s attitude toward themselves—i.e., whether the agent likes them.  
     - Our experiment is primarily concerned with the user’s own feelings and the overall interaction atmosphere, not the user’s guess about the agent’s internal attitude.  
     - If the agent does not explicitly express “liking” (it only uses gestures or simple prompts), participants cannot reliably judge this, introducing noise and detracting from measuring true rapport or trust.  
     - Removing this item keeps the questionnaire focused on the user’s direct experience rather than a secondary inference about how the user thinks the agent feels about them.
