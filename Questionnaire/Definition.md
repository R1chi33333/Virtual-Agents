### Rapport vs. Connectedness in Human–Agent Interaction

| Dimension | **Rapport** | **Connectedness / Closeness** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Core definition** | *Moment-to-moment interaction quality* — a state marked by mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination.<br>*“Rapport is a relation marked by mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination.”* — Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal (1990) | *Enduring social bond* — the degree to which the agent is included in the user’s sense of self or perceived as “part of my circle.”<br>*“Closeness exists when a person’s representation of self includes the other.”* — Aron et al. (1992) |
| **Temporal scope** | **Micro / immediate** — can rise or fall within a single conversation or scene. | **Macro / cumulative** — develops over repeated interactions and tends to stabilize over time. |
| **Experiential focus** | • Smooth, natural, relaxed dialogue<br>• Mutual attention and timely responses<br>• The feeling of “being in sync” right now | • Feeling on the same team / sense of partnership<br>• Missing the agent when absent<br>• Importance of the agent in one’s self-concept |
| **Typical research question** | “Does this dialogue strategy instantly raise the rapport users feel with the agent?” | “After multiple scenes, does identity continuity lead to a deeper overall bond with the agent?” |
| **Relation to trust** | High rapport often acts as an early **precursor** to trust, emphasising interaction climate. | High connectedness usually co-exists with **deeper trust** and willingness to rely on the agent, reflecting emotional attachment. |
