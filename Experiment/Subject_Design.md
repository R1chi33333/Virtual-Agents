# Between-Subjects vs. Within-Subjects Design

## Between-Subjects Design
**Pros:**
- No carryover or order effects.
- Only 4 VR games per participant → less fatigue and lower motion-sickness risk.
- Simple to implement: one group sees continuous identity, the other sees discontinuous.

**Cons:**
- Requires more participants for adequate statistical power.
- Individual differences add noise (even with random assignment).
- Must ensure groups are comparable.

## Within-Subjects Design
**Pros:**
- Each person serves as their own control → controls individual differences.
- Higher statistical power with fewer participants.
- All participants experience all 4 games under both conditions → balanced game effects.

**Cons:**
- Order and carryover effects: experiencing one condition influences the next.
- Participants must play 8 VR sessions → higher fatigue and potential VR sickness.
- Complex logistics: counterbalance order or provide alternate game sets to avoid practice effects.

## Final Decision
Use a **between-subjects design**:
- Each participant plays 4 games in only one condition (continuous vs. discontinuous identity).
- Avoids fatigue, order effects, and Hypothesis guessing.
- Manage individual variability by recruiting a sufficient sample size.
