# One Soul, Many Forms: Influence of Identity Continuity in Virtual Agents
## Abstract
This proposal investigates how maintaining a consistent identity across multiple virtual agent embodiments affects user experience in VR. We will study whether identity continuity (one agent persona with changing form) versus identity discontinuity (different personas in each form) alters users’ rapport, emotional connectedness, and perceived credibility. Four VR scenarios with different agent forms (human avatar, animal companion, embodied object, voice-only) will be used. In a controlled between-subject design, participants will experience both continuity conditions. Rapport and connectedness will be measured quantitatively via validated Likert scales (HARQ and ASAQ), while credibility will be assessed qualitatively through post-experience interviews
We hypothesize that continuous identity yields higher rapport and connectedness than discontinuous identity.Expected findings will deepen theory on agent persona design and offer practical guidelines for VR agent development.

## Introduction

As virtual agents move across platforms, devices, and forms, it’s important to help users still feel like they’re interacting with the same agent and this study explores how to make that work in a way people can connect with.Virtual reality (VR) enables immersive interactions with virtual agents of various forms. These agents can appear as human-like avatars, animals, objects, or even disembodied voices. A key open question is whether users perceive these different forms as one individual agent or as separate entities, and how that perception influences the social bond. We term this factor identity continuity: whether an agent’s identity (e.g. name, voice, style) is preserved across form changes. Maintaining identity continuity could strengthen the user’s sense of an ongoing relationship; breaking it might hinder rapport. This study asks: Does maintaining **identity continuity** in virtual agents with changing appearances help users maintain or **strengthen** their sense of **rapport**, **emotional connectedness** and **credibility** in **VR GAMES**?

This question addresses a gap in HCI/VR research. Previous work has explored agent embodiment and social presence, but seldom the effect of persona consistency across form changes. Rapport (moment-to-moment interaction quality) and emotional connectedness (deeper sense of closeness) are critical for trust and engagement in human-agent interaction. For example, rapport is “a state marked by mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination”, while connectedness involves viewing the agent as part of one’s social circle. Yet it is unclear if shifting a virtual agent’s appearance (from a guide avatar to a companion dog, etc.) disrupts these bonds. Our motivation is twofold: theoretically, we will extend understanding of identity and social bonding in VR; practically, we will inform VR developers how to design agent identities for better user experience. If continuity matters, developers should keep persona cues consistent; if not, more flexibility is possible. This proposal outlines a systematic experiment to test these ideas.
