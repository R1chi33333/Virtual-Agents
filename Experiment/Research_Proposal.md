# One Soul, Many Forms: Influence of Identity Continuity in Virtual Agents
## Abstract
This proposal investigates how maintaining a consistent identity across multiple virtual agent embodiments affects user experience in VR. We will study whether identity continuity (one agent persona with changing form) versus identity discontinuity (different personas in each form) alters usersâ€™ rapport, emotional connectedness, and perceived credibility. Four VR scenarios with different agent forms (human avatar, animal companion, embodied object, voice-only) will be used. In a controlled within-subject design, participants will experience both continuity conditions. Rapport and connectedness will be measured quantitatively via validated Likert scales (HARQ and ASAQ), while credibility will be assessed qualitatively through post-experience interviews
We hypothesize that continuous identity yields higher rapport and connectedness than discontinuous identity.Expected findings will deepen theory on agent persona design and offer practical guidelines for VR agent development.
