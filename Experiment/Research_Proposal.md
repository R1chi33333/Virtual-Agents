# One Soul, Many Forms: Influence of Identity Continuity in Virtual Agents
## Abstract
This proposal investigates how maintaining a consistent identity across multiple virtual agent embodiments affects user experience in VR. We will study whether identity continuity (one agent persona with changing form) versus identity discontinuity (different personas in each form) alters users’ rapport, emotional connectedness, and perceived credibility. Four VR scenarios with different agent forms (human avatar, animal companion, embodied object, voice-only) will be used. In a controlled between-subject design, participants will experience both continuity conditions. Rapport and connectedness will be measured quantitatively via validated Likert scales (HARQ and ASAQ), while credibility will be assessed qualitatively through post-experience interviews
We hypothesize that continuous identity yields higher rapport and connectedness than discontinuous identity.Expected findings will deepen theory on agent persona design and offer practical guidelines for VR agent development.

## Introduction

As virtual agents move across platforms, devices, and forms, it’s important to help users still feel like they’re interacting with the same agent and this study explores how to make that work in a way people can connect with.Virtual reality (VR) enables immersive interactions with virtual agents of various forms. These agents can appear as human-like avatars, animals, objects, or even disembodied voices. A key open question is whether users perceive these different forms as one individual agent or as separate entities, and how that perception influences the social bond. We term this factor identity continuity: whether an agent’s identity (e.g. name, voice, style) is preserved across form changes. Maintaining identity continuity could strengthen the user’s sense of an ongoing relationship; breaking it might hinder rapport. This study asks: Does maintaining **identity continuity** in virtual agents with changing appearances help users maintain or **strengthen** their sense of **rapport**, **emotional connectedness** and **credibility** in **VR GAMES**?

This question addresses a gap in HCI/VR research. Previous work has explored agent embodiment and social presence, but seldom the effect of persona consistency across form changes. Rapport (moment-to-moment interaction quality) and emotional connectedness (deeper sense of closeness) are critical for trust and engagement in human-agent interaction. For example, rapport is “a state marked by mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination”, while connectedness involves viewing the agent as part of one’s social circle. Yet it is unclear if shifting a virtual agent’s appearance (from a guide avatar to a companion dog, etc.) disrupts these bonds. Our motivation is twofold: theoretically, we will extend understanding of identity and social bonding in VR; practically, we will inform VR developers how to design agent identities for better user experience. If continuity matters, developers should keep persona cues consistent; if not, more flexibility is possible. This proposal outlines a systematic experiment to test these ideas.

## Literature Review
### 1.Identity Continuity

In human–computer interaction, an agent’s identity cues (name, voice, color scheme) shape user perceptions. In narrative theory and psychology, maintaining a consistent character across scenes strengthens the user’s sense of continuity. For example, in storytelling or game design, a character’s persistent identity often yields greater emotional investment. However, little prior work has examined identity consistency across multi-form agents in VR. Existing VR research has examined agent embodiment (e.g. how animal vs. human agents influence empathy) and social presence, but typically with a single agent form. Studies on robot consistency show that repeated interactions with the same persona can build trust, while changing persona might confuse users. We draw on analogous findings from social robot research (e.g. user trust in physically embodied agents) to posit that identity continuity in VR will similarly affect relational outcomes.

### 2.Rapport vs. Emotional Connectedness. 
These are distinct but related constructs. Rapport refers to the immediate quality of interaction: the feeling that communication is smooth and coordinated. Tickle-Degnen and Rosenthal define rapport as mutual attentiveness, positivity, and coordination. In VR, high rapport might manifest as users feeling “in sync” with an agent’s dialogue or actions. Emotional connectedness (or closeness) is a longer-term bond: how much the agent feels like part of the user’s social circle. Aron et al. note that closeness “exists when a person’s representation of self includes the other”. In our context, connectedness reflects how much a user feels allied with the agent across scenes. We expect that rapport can fluctuate scene-to-scene, while connectedness accumulates over the experiment. High rapport often precedes trust, whereas high connectedness coexists with deep trust (building on literature in trust and virtual agents.
