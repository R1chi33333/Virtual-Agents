### VR Demo Summaries

- **Escape Room — Embodied Agent**  
  You stand in a locked puzzle chamber. A humanoid companion shares the space, pointing out clues, offering verbal hints, and reacting to your progress. With VR hands you grab, rotate, and combine objects until the exit door unlocks.

- **The World Beyond — Animal Agent**  
  A mixed-reality creature named Oppy follows you around your real room. Using a magic flashlight, you reveal glowing orbs behind virtual “portals,” toss them to Oppy, and guide it with simple gestures or voice commands as it responds playfully.

- **Phanto — Object-Based Agent (Talking Gun)**  
  Your sidekick is the Polterblast 3000—a sentient ghost-blaster that chats like a *Rick and Morty* gag where the gun has Morty’s personality. It cracks jokes, warns of phantoms, and coaches your aim while you spray ectoplasmic goo and vacuum it back up.

- **Whisperer — Voice-Only Agent**  
  No avatar appears. An unseen “translator” whispers riddles and clues. You reply aloud; the environment changes according to recognized intents. The agent exists purely as a disembodied voice that mediates the interaction.
