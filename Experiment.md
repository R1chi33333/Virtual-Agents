# VR Study: Identity Continuity & User Relationship with Multi-Form Virtual Agents

## Study Overview  
Four open-source VR demos are used, each featuring a different **agent form**.  
Identity continuity is manipulated between subjects.

| VR Demo | Agent Form | Scene Focus |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Escape Room** | Embodied (human) | Puzzle solving |
| **The World Beyond** | Animal partner | Companion exploration |
| **Phanto** | Object-based (weapon AI) | MR shooting / cleaning |
| **Whisperer (reworked)** | Voice-only | Dialogue-driven puzzle |

### Conditions
| Condition | Identity Treatment | Key Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **C1 (identity discontinuous)** | Four different names, voices, color themes (A/B/C/D) | Each agent is a unique persona |
| **C2 (identity continuous)** | Same name, voice & signature color across all four demos | Minor cosmetic tweaks only |

---

## Research Question  
> Does keeping the **same identity** across visually different agents improve users’ **rapport**, **connectedness**, and **perceived trustworthiness** in VR?

---

## Hypotheses
| ID | Statement |
|----|-----------|
| **H1 (Rapport)** | Continuous identity → higher rapport scores than discontinuous identity. |
| **H2 (Connectedness)** | Continuous identity → higher connectedness scores than discontinuous identity. |

*(Trust is explored qualitatively; no directional hypothesis tested.)*

## Measurements

| Construct | Method | Scale / Source | When collected |
|-----------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Rapport** | Quantitative | Gratch et al. 15-item Rapport Scale (7-point Likert) | **Immediately after each scene** (4 times) |
| **Connectedness / Closeness** | Quantitative | IOS (Inclusion of Other in Self) *or* RISC scale (7-point Likert) | **Immediately after each scene** (4 times) |
| **Trustworthiness** | **Qualitative only** | Semi-structured exit interview (audio-recorded) | **Once, after all four scenes** |
| **Manipulation Check** | Single Likert item—“Were the assistants the same individual?” | 7-point Likert | After final scene |

## Methodology

### 1. Participants  
- **Sample size:** *N* = 48 (power analysis for mixed ANOVA, f = .25, α = .05, power ≥ .80).  
- **Recruitment:** University student pool + local VR enthusiasts; age 18–35; normal or corrected-to-normal vision; no severe motion-sickness history.  
- **Assignment:** Randomly assigned to one of two **Identity** groups  
  - **Continuous** (n ≈ 24)  
  - **Discontinuous** (n ≈ 24)

### 2. Design  
| Factor | Levels | Type |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Identity Continuity** | Continuous vs. Discontinuous | **Between-subjects** |
| **Agent / Scene** | 4 VR demos (Embodied, Animal, Object, Voice) | **Within-subjects** |

> Dependent variables: **Rapport score**, **Connectedness score** (scene-by-scene).  
> Qualitative outcome: **Perceived trustworthiness** (exit interview).

### 3. Apparatus & Materials  
- **Hardware:** Meta Quest 2 / 3 + hand controllers; PC w/ Unity 2022.3 LTS for runtime logging.  
- **VR demos:**  
  1. *Escape Room* – Embodied agent  
  2. *The World Beyond* – Animal agent  
  3. *Phanto* – Object-based agent (weapon AI)  
  4. *Whisperer* (re-scripted) – Voice-only agent  
- **Identity manipulation:**  
  - *Continuous* group: same name **“Lumi”**, same voice, same blue diamond badge across all demos (only scene-specific cosmetic tweaks).  
  - *Discontinuous* group: unique names, voices, colors (A/B/C/D) per demo.  
- **Questionnaires:**  
  - **Rapport Scale** (Gratch et al., 15 items, 7-point Likert)  
  - **Connectedness:** IOS single-item (7-point pictorial)  
  - **Manipulation-check:** “These assistants felt like the same person” (1–7 Likert)

### 4. Procedure  
1. **Briefing & Consent** → demographic survey.  
2. Participants experience **all four demos** (counter-balanced order, ∼6 min each).  
3. **After each demo** → Immediate Likert survey (Rapport + Connectedness).  
4. **Post block:**  
   - Manipulation-check item  
   - **Exit interview** (audio-recorded, 10 min): trust perceptions, moments of high/low trust, impact of identity cues.  
5. **Debrief & compensation**.

### 5. Data Analysis  
- **Quantitative:** 2 (Identity) × 4 (Scene) mixed ANOVA (or linear mixed-effects) on Rapport & Connectedness.  
  - Post-hoc pairwise (Bonferroni) if interaction significant.  
  - Cronbach’s α to confirm Rapport scale reliability.  
- **Qualitative:** Thematic analysis of interview transcripts (Braun & Clarke, 2006) focusing on trust themes; representative quotes reported to contextualise quantitative results.  
- **Manipulation-check:** Independent-samples t-test; participants who fail (< 3 in continuous or > 5 in discontinuous) excluded from confirmatory analysis.

### 6. Ethical Considerations  
- Ethics approval obtained from institutional review board.  
- Participants free to withdraw; resting breaks provided to mitigate VR fatigue; data anonymised and stored on encrypted drives.

> **Outcome:** This mixed-method design quantifies how identity continuity influences rapport & connectedness across four agent forms, and qualitatively explains the trust mechanisms behind those effects.
