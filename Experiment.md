# VR Study: Identity Continuity & User Relationship with Multi-Form Virtual Agents

## Study Overview  
Four open-source VR demos are used, each featuring a different **agent form**.  
Identity continuity is manipulated between subjects.

| VR Demo | Agent Form | Scene Focus |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Escape Room** | Embodied (human) | Puzzle solving |
| **The World Beyond** | Animal partner | Companion exploration |
| **Phanto** | Object-based (weapon AI) | MR shooting / cleaning |
| **Whisperer (reworked)** | Voice-only | Dialogue-driven puzzle |

### Conditions
| Condition | Identity Treatment | Key Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **C1 (identity discontinuous)** | Four different names, voices, color themes (A/B/C/D) | Each agent is a unique persona |
| **C2 (identity continuous)** | Same name, voice & signature color across all four demos | Minor cosmetic tweaks only |

---

## Research Question  
> Does keeping the **same identity** across visually different agents improve users’ **rapport**, **connectedness**, and **perceived trustworthiness** in VR?

---

## Hypotheses
| ID | Statement |
|----|-----------|
| **H1 (Rapport)** | Continuous identity → higher rapport scores than discontinuous identity. |
| **H2 (Connectedness)** | Continuous identity → higher connectedness scores than discontinuous identity. |

*(Trust is explored qualitatively; no directional hypothesis tested.)*

## Measurements

| Construct | Method | Scale / Source | When collected |
|-----------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Rapport** | Quantitative | Gratch et al. 15-item Rapport Scale (7-point Likert) | **Immediately after each scene** (4 times) |
| **Connectedness / Closeness** | Quantitative | IOS (Inclusion of Other in Self) *or* RISC scale (7-point Likert) | **Immediately after each scene** (4 times) |
| **Trustworthiness** | **Qualitative only** | Semi-structured exit interview (audio-recorded) | **Once, after all four scenes** |
| **Manipulation Check** | Single Likert item—“Were the assistants the same individual?” | 7-point Likert | After final scene |
